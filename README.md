Howdy all,

My name is Nick and I am an aspiring Game Developer. Growing up on books like The Avatar Chronicles by Conor Kostick, I have always dreamed of getting to breathe life into a story and become a Game Developer.

I have completed college courses in Java and C++, and I have self-taught myself the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. I even competed in the State of Ohio for Webdesign and C++ in High School.

I am currently working on developing a Side-Project named Faith, a real-time strategy game where the Lesser Spirits of Altriux battle for supremacy and the title of True God.

If you have any questions, comments, or feedback, I am ALWAYS happy to hear it!

Without critism, how does one grow? Please feel free to pour over my code and point out my silly mistakes or royal failures, I'll always appreciate it!
